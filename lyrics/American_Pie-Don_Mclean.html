  <br>American Pie
  Don Mclean
  
  Verse 1
  A long, long time ago,
  I can still remember how that
  music used to make me smile
  And I knew if
  I had my chance,
  That I could make those
  people dance
  and maybe they'd
  be happy for a while
  
  Pre-Chorus 1
  But February made me shiver,
  with every paper I'd deliver
  Bad news on the doorstep,
  I couldn't take one more step
  I can't remember if I
  cried when I read about
  his widowed bride
  Something touched me
  deep inside
  The day the music died
  
  Chorus 1
  So bye, bye Miss American Pie
  Drove my Chevy to the levy but the
  levy was dry
  And them good old boys were drinkin'
  whiskey and rye Singin'
  this will be the day that I die,
  this will be the day that I die
  
  Verse 2
  Did you write the book of love
  And do you have
  faith in god above,
  if the bible tells you so?
  Do you believe
  in rock and roll
  Can music save
  your mortal soul
  and can you teach
  me how to dance real slow?
  
  Pre-Chorus 2
  Well I know that you're in love with him
  'cuz I saw you dancin' in the gym
  You both kicked off your shoes,
  man I dig those rhythm and blues
  I was a lonely teenage bronckin' buck
  with a pink carnation and a pickup truck
  But I knew I was out of luck the
  day the music died,
  
  I started singin'
  
  Chorus 2
  Bye, bye Miss American Pie
  Drove my Chevy to the levy but the
  levy was dry
  And them good old boys were drinkin'
  whiskey and rye Singin'
  this will be the day that I die,
  this will be the day that I die
  
  Verse 3
  Now for ten years
  we've been on our own,
  and moss grows fat on a rolling stone
  but that's not how it used to be
  When the jester sang for the
  king and queen in a coat he borrowed
  from James Dean in
  a voice that came from you and me
  
  Pre-Chorus 3
  Oh, and while the king
  was looking down,
  the jester stole his thorny crown
  The courtroom was adjourned,
  no verdict was returned
  And while Lennon read
  a book on Marx,
  the quartet practiced in the park
  And we sang dirges in the dark the
  day the music died,
  
  we were singin'
  
  Chorus 3
  Bye, bye Miss American Pie
  Drove my Chevy to the levy but the
  levy was dry
  And them good old boys were drinkin'
  whiskey and rye Singin'
  this will be the day that I die,
  this will be the day that I die
  
  Verse 4
  Helter skelter in a summer swelter
  the birds flew off with a fallout shelter,
   eight miles high and fallin' fast
  It landed foul on the grass
  the players tried for a forward pass,
  with the jester on
  the sidelines in a cast
  
  Pre-Chorus 4
  Now the half-time air
  was sweet perfume,
  while sergeants played a marching tune
  We all got up to dance, but
  we never got the chance
  'Cuz the players tried to
  take the field,
  the marching band reCmfused to yield
  Do you recall what was revealed the
  day the music died,
  
  we started singin'
  
  Chorus 4
  Bye, bye Miss American Pie
  Drove my Chevy to the levy but the
  levy was dry
  And them good old boys were drinkin'
  whiskey and rye Singin' this will be the
  day that I die,
  this will be the day that I die
  
  Verse 5
  And there we were
  all in one place,
  a generation lost in space,
  with no time left to start again
  So come on Jack be nimble,
  Jack be quick,
  Jack Flash sat on a candle stick,
  'cuz fire is the devil's only friend
  
  Pre-Chorus 5
  And as I watched him
  on the stage,
  my hands were clenched
  in fists of rage
  No angel born in Hell could
  break that Satan's spell
  And as the flames climbed high
  into the night
  to light the sacrificial rite
  I saw Satan laughing with delight
  the day the music died,
  
  Chorus 5
  he was singin'
  
  Bye, bye Miss American Pie
  Drove my Chevy to the levy but the
  levy was dry
  And them good old boys were drinkin'
  whiskey and rye Singin'
  this will be the day that I die,
  this will be the day that I die
  
  Verse 6 (Soft)
  I met a girl who sang the blues
  And I asked her for some happy news,
  but she just smiled and turned away
  I went down to the sacred store
  Where I'd heard the
  music years before, but the man there
  said the music wouldn't play
  
  Pre-Chorus 6 (Soft)
  But in the streets the Am*children screamed,
  the lovers cried and the Am*poets dreamed
  But not a word was spoken,
  the church bells all were broken
  And the three men I admire most,
  the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
  They caught the
  last train for the coast
  the day the music died,
  
  And they were singin'
  
  Chorus 6 (Soft)
  Bye, bye Miss American Pie
  Drove my Chevy to the levy but the
  levy was dry And them good old
  boys were drinkin' whiskey
  and rye Singin'
  this will be the day that I die,
  this will be the day that I die
  
  They were singin'
  
  Outro
  bye, bye Miss American Pie
  Drove my Chevy to the levy but the
  levy was dry And them good old
  boys were drinkin'
  whiskey and rye Singin'
  this will be the day that I die.
